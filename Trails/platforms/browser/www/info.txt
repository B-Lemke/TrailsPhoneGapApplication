#By: Broderick Lemke
#Libraries: P5.js
#Project Name: Trails
#Project Goal: Create a piece of art using javascript.
#Current Status: Not being worked on. Completed.
#Future Possibilities: It would be interesting to change the color values and save the output as a series of artistic panels. Additionally it would be interesting to have this displayed on a small monitor controlled by a raspberry pi or something to just keep on a desk as a decoration. It could eb modified to change colors more and not stop after a certain number of times.
